using namespace std;


//Part 1:  Run the test code using the stl vector class.  Make sure you understand the output
//		   and how the vector class works.
//Part 2:  Create your own vector class (in the file "myVector.h").  To test your vector class,
//		   Swap the #include statements above so that the test code uses your vector class instead of the stl vector class.
//         
//		   YOU MAY NOT CHANGE ANY PART OF THE TEST CODE other than swapping the included files.
//         Your vector class must yield the exact same results from the test code as the stl vector class,
//         with the following exceptions: The "capacity" method may return different values (ie, you may choose any resizing method you want,
//		   but you should consider what is the smartest approach with respect to efficiency).  Additionally, for the 0-parameter constructor and
//		   the 1-parameter, you do not need to initialize the values of the vector items (but you must for the 2-parameter constructor).
//         Beyond these items, your code must behave the same as for the stl vector.
